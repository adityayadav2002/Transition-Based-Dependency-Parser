📌 Overview

This project implements a Transition-Based Dependency Parser (similar to the classic Arc-Eager/Arc-Standard models).
The parser is trained on the Universal Dependencies English-EWT Treebank and learns to predict parsing transitions using a machine-learning classifier.

🎯 Objectives

Build a dependency parser from scratch

Use stack–buffer transition architecture

Implement transitions: SHIFT, LEFT-ARC, RIGHT-ARC

Extract training features from gold treebank

Train a classifier to predict transitions

Evaluate using UAS (Unlabelled Attachment Score)

Parse new sentences using the model
